This Java code creates a new simple interface for file management, similar to that of Windows.

ðŸ‘¾TO RUN:
Apache NetBeans IDE 16 was used for development, you can start the program by loading the code and starting it.
To modify your files (add folders, delete them, modify files etc.) just click the buttons on the graphical interface started from the console.
I recommend keeping the same versions of the IDE indicated, in order not to encounter errors.
